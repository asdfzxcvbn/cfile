# cfile

**c**ompare **file**s, a super simple tool that.. you know, compares files. (very lazily) written in python3, with some help from chatgpt.

### how to installation ?!

`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asdfzxcvbn/cfile/main/cfile.py -O /usr/local/bin/cfile`

`sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cfile`

### why the name cfile?

because i am unoriginal.

### why is the code so bad?
